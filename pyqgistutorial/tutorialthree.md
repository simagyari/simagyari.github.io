title: Tutorial 3 - PyQGIS processing scripts
---


# Introduction
This tutorial has been made as an output of my 70-hour placement project for GEOG5230M Professional Development at MSc River Basin Dynamics and Management with GIS at the University of Leeds. The aim of this project is to showcase a possible solution for creating an e-learning tool to teach Python in QGIS to students in water-related fields.

To complete these tutorials, a basic understanding of Python, its data structures, functions, and classes is required, as well as some familiarity with the desktop usage of QGIS3. To follow the tutorial, an installation of QGIS 3.10 A Coruna Long Term Release is required. The code has not been tested and adapted to other versions of QGIS, although it might work with them.

This is the third, and final, tutorial, talking about turning Console-based processing algorithms into a Script in the Processing Toolbox with GUI functionality.

# Create Script from Template
To turn our Tutorial 2 code into a Script, we first have to initialise one. From the Toolbox, open a Scripts icon, then click on `New Script from Template`. This will give you a file with a lot of code, not all of which you will need. We will walk through it (mostly) from top down and change, add, or remove items to make it work for our case.
