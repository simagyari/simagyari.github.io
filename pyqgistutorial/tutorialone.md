title: Tutorial 1 - PyQGIS basics
---


# Introduction
This tutorial has been made as an output of my 70-hour placement project for GEOG5230M Professional Development at MSc River Basin Dynamics and Management with GIS at the University of Leeds. The aim of this project is to showcase a possible solution for creating an e-learning tool to teach Python in QGIS to students in water-related fields.

To complete these tutorials, a basic understanding of Python, its data structures, functions, and classes is required, as well as some familiarity with the desktop usage of QGIS3. To follow the tutorial, an installation of QGIS 3.10 A Coruna Long Term Release is required. The code has not been tested and adapted to other versions of QGIS, although it might work with them.

This is the first tutorial, talking about accessing Python functionality and basic layer manipulation inside the QGIS Python Console.
