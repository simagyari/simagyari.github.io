# Description
This application enables the users to choose between industrial site locations on a raster map of Great Britain. The software uses three maps as input, with values between 0 and 255, depicting the geology, population, and transport characteristics of areas. These maps are then averaged based on their relative importance, which is set by the user, using three scalebars. Then it displays the map chosen by the user on a greyscale image, optionally with the top 10% of values in a blue colour scheme. The displayed maps can be saved as .csv files to any location specified by the user through a pop-up file dialog window. For technical information, and guidelines on installing and running the application, please refer to the [README](https://github.com/simagyari/GEOG5990M_Assignment2/blob/main/README.md) file of the [project repository](https://github.com/simagyari/GEOG5990M_Assignment2).
